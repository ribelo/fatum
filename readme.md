railway oriented programming for `clojure` & `clojurescript`


# motivation

`fatum` was basically a friendly copy of [fmnoise/flow](https://github.com/fmnoise/flow) with a pinch of [failjure](https://github.com/adambard/failjure), but it went in a slightly different direction to suit my personal needs. unfortunately or fortunately i don&rsquo;t agree with most of the small decisions made by [alex](https://github.com/fmnoise) that don&rsquo;t affect the overall applicability of library, but strongly affect my personal user experience, starting from the use of `->>` instead of `->`, to naming the catching function `else` instead of `catch` as it is in `javascript` for example. [flow](https://github.com/fmnoise/flow) is a excellent piece of code and i have enjoyed using it for a long time.
