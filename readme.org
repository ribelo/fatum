railway oriented programming for =clojure= & =clojurescript=

* motivation

=fatum= was basically a friendly copy of [[https://github.com/fmnoise/flow][fmnoise/flow]] with a pinch of [[https://github.com/adambard/failjure][failjure]],
but it went in a slightly different direction to suit my personal needs.
unfortunately or fortunately i don't agree with most of the small decisions made
by [[https://github.com/fmnoise][alex]] that don't affect the overall applicability of library, but strongly
affect my personal user experience, starting from the use of =->>= instead of =->=,
to naming the catching function =else= instead of =catch= as it is in =javascript= for
example. [[https://github.com/fmnoise/flow][flow]] is a excellent piece of code and i have enjoyed using it for a
long time.
